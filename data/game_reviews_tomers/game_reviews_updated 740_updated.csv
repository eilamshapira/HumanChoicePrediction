16447,Hotel Evergreen,"Room was clean and shower was good. In general was OK
Not specific great thing,, however one good thing is 24/7 reception ","It doesn't have elevators,  careful if you have very heavy / large luggage 
The location wasn't very good at all. I booked this place only because it's closer to the airport but in the morning I cancelled the Uber as it would take 18 minutes for the car just to arrive and pick me up. I asked hotel to call a taxi,  theirs took 15 minutes to reach and finally 41 euros yo charge. Between city and this place, using public transport meant too many changes or too much walking ",5.4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
16689,Hotel Evergreen,"Good transport system, enough close to airport, near is Lidl, so i could buy for nice price salat for dinner. ","In the evening of the first day there was no hot water.
