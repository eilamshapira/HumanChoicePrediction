9110,Guest House Huyze Die Maene,Beautiful and comfortable room. The hotel room exceeded my expectation! I felt like a queen in this spacious room which had beautiful paintings and huge Belgian lace in a glass frame.  Great view of the Grote Markt and had a good view of the parade and festivities in the square.  I loved the Belgian Waffle served in the hotel for breakfast!,None,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
