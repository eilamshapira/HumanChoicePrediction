25214,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,This was an ideal location across the street from Antwerp Central train station so getting around is very easy. The staff was friendly. The only downfall was that the mattresses are a bit thin but the price for the length of my stay was very good. The location itself is close to many restaurants and shops so there's a lot to do there!,Mattresses are a bit thin.,8.3,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
