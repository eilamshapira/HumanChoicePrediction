4400,B&B Pittoresque,"The personal service was excellent: Breakfast served on the terrace one day and an  ""in room breakfast"" for the day we had an early departure",the room wasn't overly clean (dust) and sound proofing to other rooms / staircase is not the greatest.

4517,B&B Pittoresque,The region. The WiFi worked very well. It was quiet.,"Not at all ""Pittoresque""! No parking, many stairs to climb before you enter the house, no WC in the room or bath room, very small bathroom with a very small washbasin without plug that would rather expect in a toilet, breakfast OK but by no means something special as described on their website",5.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
