75,B&B Hof Beygaert,"I really loved the accommodation. The lady who runs the place is very friendly. The rooms are in an old farm which has been renovated with much taste. The breakfast was very good. Although not far away from a rather busy street, the house is in a quite neighbourhood where you can sleep with an open window and in the morning enjoy the birds singing.",,9.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
