26176,B&B 't Huys van Enaeme,"The room was spacious and tastefully decorated. There was a sofa in the room where we could sit in the evening to relax with the spectacularly good Belgian beers. We brought our bikes and kept them in the owner's garage for security. Just around the corner from the B&B is a the Kattenberg climb to warm you up. The countryside and river track are close by for cyclists and walkers. The restaurant Paulette (5 minutes walk) is outstanding and not to be missed. The host, Katrien, is friendly, welcoming and helpful. We stayed for five nights and could have stayed longer. This is an outstanding B&B and we'd love to come back.",Nothing,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
