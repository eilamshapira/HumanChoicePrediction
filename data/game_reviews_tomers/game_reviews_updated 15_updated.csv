19621,Albert Moliere,The style of the property mixes contemporary with traditional is a harmonious way.  The staff were friendly and spoke English fluently.  The car parking was safe and adjacent. The breakfast was delicious and kept us going all day.,"I wondered if our room (which was decided off from the one next door by sliding pocket doors) was as private as if there had been a wall instead.
