Staff were friendly. ","Pillows for your beds are cushions leading to a very uncomfortable sleep.
They're having renovation works but we were not told beforehand at any time.
Noisy from all the renovation works.
We felt like we were in the way of the workmen and unsure if the kitchen was still operational. ",7.1,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
