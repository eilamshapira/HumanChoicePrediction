17969,Jam Hotel,"Nice hotel concept ""charming concrete"" which generates a quite unique visual identity. Many details (bunk beds for kids with sliding doors etc). The rooftop pool looked quite inviting and also the bar on top is very nice with some view over the city. The staff is friendly and helpful when approached.","Family room for five was generally set up in a nice way due to the bunk bed concept. However, for 5 people and luggage the room was small. Certainly not the place to spend more time than for sleeping and bathroom. The place can have somewhat of a youth hostel feeling, it needs some initiative from the guests to get stuff done.",7.1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
