9210,Guest House Huyze Die Maene,"UNBELIEVABLE location, one of the best views I ever had. You are in a medieval house, with painted glass windows, and it is just BREATHTAKING.

9299,Guest House Huyze Die Maene,Location and space in the rooms was fantastic,"Very difficult to find as the guest house is above a restaurant,by the same name but operated by different owners. The heating was not working and the rooms were too hot, requiring multiple requests to adjust but to no avail. The staff in the restaurant were not very accommodating for the guests in the hotel.",7.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
