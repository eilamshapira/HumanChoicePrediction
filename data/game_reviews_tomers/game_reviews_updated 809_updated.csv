15539,Hotel Monasterium PoortAckere,Location for exploring Ghent,"Booked a Superior room based on the Booking Web site photos to get the best quality room. But on arrival given a room no better than Standard in quality. Management said all rooms different, but I said that the room paid for should still be of a similar Superior standard to that advertised. They blamed Booking.com for this but I don't. Very misleading - be warned! Make certain you are going to get what you are paying for!",4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
