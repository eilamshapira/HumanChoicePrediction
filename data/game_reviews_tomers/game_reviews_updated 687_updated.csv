12378,Hotel Class'eco Liege,"Reception available 24/7. Clean sheets and towels, comfortable bed, sink with warm water and mirror in our bedroom was very convenient, good value for money. We stayed on the third floor and our wing had two rooms only and was very quiet. Does the job for one night sleep. Good location near the highway and free parking was great!",Some toilets/showers were out of order and I imagine the guests that stayed near the toilets were always waking up with the noise flushing.,8.3,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
