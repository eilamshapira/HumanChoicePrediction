9016,DAFT Hotel & Glamping,"This is a bit unusual hotel, very tiny rooms, but very nice common spaces. The living room with the views towards nature was wonderful.  Breakfast was lovely, the small pancakes brought to the table were supper fluffy and melting in the mouth.  The pool is tiny and a bit cold, but our kids enjoyed it. It was very quiet at night.","For a hotel attached to a recording studio, I did not expect to have radio blasting in the common spaces. Would it be difficult to play some record or a playlist? The lightning in the room was dim.",9.2,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
