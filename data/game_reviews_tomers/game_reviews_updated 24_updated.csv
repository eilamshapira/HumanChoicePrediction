11426,Alliance Hotel Ieper Centrum,"Value for money was excellent, room size, location was great and the hotel reception was good. Also garage parking for up to 6 motorcycles (at a push)",It's a minor point but water for boiled eggs needs to be boiling! Also a bigger toaster would help but all in all not a bad stay and value for money. Being able to arrive and drop things off would help as the check in time is 4 pm.,8.3,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
