No breakfast is available (as stated), but there is coffee making facilities, a fridge and a microwave in the room, and there are plenty of cafes nearby too. Good communication with the host.","You have to go up a steep, narrow staircase to get to the room (no lift). We struggled a little with the luggage. Not really a complaint, but something to be aware of for people with less mobility.",10,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
