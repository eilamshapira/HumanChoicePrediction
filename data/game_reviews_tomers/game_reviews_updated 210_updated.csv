701,B&B Het Colettientje,"The host, Maria, was a wonderful host and quite a character.  She gave us all the information we needed for our stay in Bruges.  She cooked us an exceptional omelet every morning along with fresh bread and homemade jam, salami, cheese, and the best coffee.  Her price was a very good price, the location was great, and she offered us a {costs extra} garage for our car which was a big plus.  We would stay there again for sure.",,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
