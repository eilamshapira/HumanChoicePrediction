24219,Boutique Hotel Leuvenatel,"The hotel is ideal for latecomers - walking distance from the train station and self check-in. Most of the hotels and B&B's do not accept guest arriving after 22-00. Room is spacious enough, clean and cozy, I found everything I needed and even more than you can get in a big hotel. Excellent value for money.",,9,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Would stay again.","Some weirdness with the internet connection stability and safety (got some red flags from connection security apps) throughout the stay, which can be bothersome to people travelling on business. But as far as I understood, it was a general problem all across Leuven with this internet provider during the days of my stay. Hopefully it is true.",9,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
