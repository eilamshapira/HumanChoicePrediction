14537,Axis Hotel,,This hotel is great if you travel by car. On booking.com I searched for hotels near airport with shuttel bus. This hotel came up although it does not have a shuttle bus (only if booked through a travel agency). This is misleading. It cost me 43 Eur to get there from the airport and 37 Eur back to the airport by taxi (40 minute ride in the morning due to traffic),8.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
