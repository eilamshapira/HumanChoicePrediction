22070,TripInn Eden Antwerp,The location was very accessible & convenient - 5 mins walk to Antwerp Central station and 10 mins away from the main shopping district. Many restaurant choices around the area.,"There was no heating in my room. There was an A/C unit but no remote control so the room was very cold at night. Unfortunately during my stay, the guests opposite my room were playing music (loud enough I could hear) and arguing loudly for close to 30mins.",6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
