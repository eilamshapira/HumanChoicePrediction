13248,S Hertogenmolens Hotel,"Very friendly staff, nice location and beautiful hotel. ",The rooms have wooden floors that receive a lot of noise from adjacent rooms and corridor. Also the airco (serves as heating) isn't quite. Without ear plugs I would not have been able to get a good night sleep. Rooms are also fairly cold.,7.5,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
