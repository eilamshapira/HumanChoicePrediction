4138,CityHome Antwerp,,"I am a solo female traveler. One afternoon a man turned a key and entered the apartment looking for something from the kitchen, told me he was the owner, he did not even knock at the door. I felt very unsafe for the rest of my stay and ensured the door was locked and the key was in the back of the door to stop this happening again. Absolute awful experience ",6.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
4108,CityHome Antwerp,Location and accessibility,"I felt cheated. When booking, I booked a queen bed and it showed a picture of a studio with a queen bed in it. When arriving, I walked into an entirely different looking space (cheap looking and smelling like cigarettes) that had a twin bed. When texting the hosts, they told me that the bed pulls out to a full.  There was a major lack of transparency about which room I actually booked. I didn't complain because I was only staying two nights and trying to sleep off a 9 hour jetlag.",3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3977,CityHome Antwerp,"Cozy flat in the heart of the city centre including all amenities you can wish for to feel at home. 5 min away from Groote Markt, 2 metro stops away from Antwerpen Centraal. 
Flat was clean, welcoming and quiet, the host Hong a lovely lady, was kind and helped with every issue I had. Logistics of check in and out impeccable, it was super easy to get to the flat and the landlord was super easy to reach.
I very much enjoyed my stay in this great city also because of the accommodation.
Can't wait to be back when I hope for the flat to be available. Thank you!
