873,ibis Hotel Brussels Airport,,"We were shoved in a room that smelled of smoke - I was traveling with my young children and we arrived at night.  Even though we booked a twin room, we got two tiny beds next to each other in a really tiny room.. upon complaining the check in guy came and moved the beds 6 inches apart to make it a ""twin room"".  Just ridiculous.   The room had no amenities, not even drinking water.  I was told that this is the ""standard Ibis affair"" and he claimed to have seen 13 other Ibis locations - I might have my doubts since I have stayed at various Ibis hotels as well. Stay away - far better and cheaper options available near the airport than this junk!",3.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
