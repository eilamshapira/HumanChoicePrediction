5258,Hotel Du Parlement,"Nothing to like, would not recommend.","Shabby, no lift, no telephone, poor bed linen, poor lighting, no pop up plug in sink in first room offered (receptionist blamed maid!), poor curtains did not stop street lights, paint flaking off wall, television too small  and too far away; poor breakfast with only milk available being UHT full fat which apart from its unhealthy nature tastes horrible. A thoroughly unpleasant experience. Take breakfast elsewhere.",3.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
