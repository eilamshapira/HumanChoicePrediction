20957,Hotel Ambrosia,"Stayed at this lovely bnb for a weekend getaway and to also explore the WWI sites. Everything was lovely - the bed is super comfy, the staff very friendly, and the breakfast excellent! It is right near the center of town so just an easy walk to everything. There are also bikes for rent so I took one out and the bike was also excellent.",Nothing to complain about,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
