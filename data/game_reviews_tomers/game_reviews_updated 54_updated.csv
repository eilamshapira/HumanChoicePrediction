11635,Apart! & Moment!,"Just about perfect: location, room, amenities, hospitality. What we really liked is that breakfast is optional, as the location included a bakery/patisserie and tea room of the highest quality. So youbcan breakfast whenever you want and compose something that will satisfy your cravings. If not, YOU really have a problem. ","That you can't put your feet into the see during breakfast!

11706,Apart! & Moment!,"The receptionist was very nice, although the property reception was closed by the time we arrived, he showed up right in 5 minutes after the call","Apartment is not well thought and lacks comfort due to pretentiousness for the contemporary style. Toilet is in the first and shower on the second floor. Imagine you need to use a toilet at night. You can hardly fit in the shower cabin. Sofa has stains from previous visits, apartment rules foils are all greasy, blankets have some hair on it. I am absolutely not happy with this offering, maximum price is 100$ per night.",5.8,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
