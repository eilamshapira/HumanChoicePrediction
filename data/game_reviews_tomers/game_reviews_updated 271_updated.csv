11853,B&B Ter Brugge,"The B&B is located in what feels like a wonderfully hidden corner of true Flanders (even though the entry to the highway is close) -  located alongside the canal between Ostend and Bruges, great for walking or biking,  and with views on fields and sheep from the bedroom window. The house itself is also interesting -  while the house has been re-organized for B&B purposes, historical and personal touches remain, including art.  The breakfast, served in the former living/dining room of the house, is a real treat; the hosts are friendly and service-oriented, and yes, everything is very clean.   We loved our stay there, and recommend it highly.",,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
