21730,B&B Les Dependances,The peace and quiet and breakfast was nice but a typical continental one. You were able to use the coffee machine and kettle in the kitchen if you wanted a drink.,The hotel is tucked away at the top of a very narrow twisting lane but the room we had was right at the top of the building and it was virtually impossible to stand upright due to the sloping ceilings. The bathroom was shared but I knew that before booking.,9.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
21777,B&B Les Dependances,Could be amazing. Beautiful building with quality annex design. Now needs a little 'touching up' following initial conversion. Within walking distance of Namur centre but route is mixed.,Late check in. Wi-fi - I could not get it to work.  No eating places nearby.
