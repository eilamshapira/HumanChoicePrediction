Location is excellent! ","From a 5 star hotel I expected to have more facilities like an Iron board in rooms. The were no Iron board in my room and I tried to contact the reception and houskeeping  but nobody aswered the phone. Also they charge $10 for the entree to the rooftop..even if you're a guest. That is ridiculous. I was very disappointed‚òπÔ∏è regarding the rooftop. At C/O the receptionist didn't even ask how my stay was, so I remain quiet.",7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
